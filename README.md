# VLT_MUSE_Latitude
Repository of data files associated with VLT/MUSE Latitudinal Variations Paper

This repository contains files used to determine the Latitudinal Variation of aerosols and abundances in Neptune's Atmosphere from observations made in 2019 with the MUSE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and reported in J. Geophys. Res.

The data files are as follows.

Figure 1: The MUSE data are available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7594682. The natural colour image is reproduced here, with and without gamma correction in the files:

Neptune_MUSE_sRGB_deconv.jpg and Neptune_MUSE_sRGB_deconv_Gamma.jpg 

Figure 2: The atmospheric profiles displayed are listed in:

newmodel.txt and oldmodel.txt

Figure 3: The spectra displayed are contained in the file: minnaert_refl_k_edit.txt

Figure 4: The n_imag spectra are contained in the file: nimag.txt

Figure 5: The Minnaert-fitted parameters are listed in the file: spectra_contour.txt

Figures 6 and 7: The data contained in this figures is listed in the file: gather_data1a.txt

Figure 8: The data contained in the comparison between the SPW and NDS-2018, and 20S and DBS-2019 are contained in: comparezones.txt

Figures 9 and 13: The data contained in this figures is listed in the file: gather_data3a.txt

Figure 10: The variation of single-scattering albedo with latitude at 500 and 800 nm is contained in: contour_ssa1.txt

Figure 11: The n_imag spectra shown are contained in: compare_oneshot_nimag.txt
